# Personal Website

- game:
  <a href = >

## Approach to problem (planning)

- I had first created a default react app using npx create-react-app
- Then I added my own pages
- I layed out how I wanted the site style and structure to look

## Cool tech used

- Implemented Bootstrap to get a smoother and cooler looking frontend design for my application
- Implemented sign up and sign in features
- Implemented an Edit and delete profile feature 

## Lessons I've learnt

- Handling form data can get quite messy if code is not clear and concise

## Future Features to add

- Display my projects
- Add more personal information
- Add backend data using SQL developer

Overall, this is an ongoing project which I intend to improve upon and add many more features.
