# Website
Just a general website with interactive features
<a href = "https://WalidF123.github.io/Website/">"Click here to go my site"</a>



## Approach to problem (planning)

- I had first created a default react app using npx create-react-app
- Then I added my own pages
- I layed out how I wanted the site style and structure to look
## Website Description:
- So my website is called 'SOIL', it is an interactive website where you can make an account by signing up
 - Once you sign up you get offered various features of creating a diet plan, buying produce etc.
 - The overall purpose of the website is to assist users in bettering their health

## Cool tech used

- Implemented Bootstrap to get a smoother and cooler looking frontend design for my application
- Implemented sign up and sign in features
- Implemented an Edit and delete profile feature 
- Once you sign in you can create a diet plan depending on your fitness goals
- There is also a products page where you can choose and select produce and add it to a cart


## Lessons I've learnt

- Handling form data can get quite messy if code is not clear and concise

## Future Features to add

- Add a workout plan section
- Add more personal information
- Add backend data using SQL developer, such as more diet options
- Add more specific workout and diet options that are tailored to users needs

Overall, this is an ongoing project which I intend to improve upon and add many more features.
